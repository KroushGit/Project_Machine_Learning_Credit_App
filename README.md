# Project Machine Learning Credit Web Application

## Goal of the project
The goal is to build a web application that can predict if someone deserves to obtain a bank credit based on differents data about him, such as gender, income, credit history,...
This project will use machine learning to create such predictor using python.

## The data
This is a project that I've made using data in open source from "Kaggle" and a template of web app.
I've coded the analysis and the model in Python on Google Collab.
